- **Game Development & Modding**: Game development and modding allow me to blend creativity with coding, building immersive experiences and personalizing games for unique playstyles.

I enjoy projects where these areas overlap, like open-source tools for IoT applications or community-driven game mods, and Iâ€™m always excited to learn more about new intersections between these fields.
